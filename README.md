To analyze and redesign an existing website homepage (like a small business, NGO, college, or portfolio site) to make it more user-friendly, modern, and visually balanced. This helps us learn usability heuristics, layout improvement, responsive structure, and visual hierarchy.

Redesigned website

The original website's homepage suffered from a cluttered, overwhelming navigation and a poor visual hierarchy. Crucial information like "Admissions" was hidden in a disruptive pop-up and an inaccessible scrolling ticker, providing no clear path for the user. My redesign simplifies this by introducing a single, streamlined navigation bar. I created a modern hero section using a dark overlay on the video, which improves text readability and establishes a clear focus, guiding the user directly to a prominent "Admissions Open" headline and a primary "Apply Now" button.
